For IWD, IWDEE, Baldur's Gate 2, BG2: EE, BGT and the Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).


## Description:
------------

A new merchant named Mystra's Witness at Waukeen's Promenade (in front of Fennecia's house). After talking to him, you can acquire a spell book that will teach you some divine spells (including one that can be used to turn undead), at the cost of some skill points and experience. 

This mod allows to build original class / kit combinations. (ex:  Kensaï/mage (cleric), Sorcerer (cleric) ou Skald (cleric)

If you are playing on IWDEE, the seller can be found near Orrik's tower. (But you'll be allowed to buy the spell book only once you've reached 5000 XP.)
