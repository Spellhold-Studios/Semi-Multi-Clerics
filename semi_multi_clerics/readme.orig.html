Semi-Multi Micro-Mod:</FONT>
<br><BR>

<br>Well here
it is, my attempt at a one day (well, three or four hour) micro-mod.
By bringing in an item, this mod will make available the following
Semi-multi-classes:
<br><BR>

<br>1) Single
Class Mage/Cleric (advances as Mage).
<br>2)
Sorcerer/Cleric (advances as Sorcerer)
<br>3)
Bard/Cleric (advances as Bard)
<br>4)
Cleric/Mage/Rogue (advances as Mage/Rogue)
<br>5)
Fighter/Mage/Cleric (advances as Fighter/Mage, may use Fighter
weapons)
<br>6) Kitted
versions of the above (Wild Mage/Cleric, Blade/Cleric, etc.)
<br>7) The
Fighter/Mage/Thief/Cleric (Your One Stop Shopping Character Outlet)
<br><BR>

<br>THE QUICK
README:
<br><BR>

<br>For
BG2:SOA and ToB. Install as per any other IAP, CLUA in TACPRSP and
use the manual in your quick item slot. If you don’t get all 24
spells, CLUA in TACPRS2 and use that repeatedly in the quick slot
until all spells appear in your Mage’s spell book. If the Mages
book is full, you’ll have to remove older spells to see the new
ones.

	<br>THE
	LONGER, DULLER README:
	<br><BR>
	
	<br>The
	semi-multi learns and uses spells as per a normal Arcane caster, and
	also has access to 35 clerical spells, including one that duplicates
	the effect of the cleric’s Turn Undead. These spells must be
	memorized and cast as if they were Arcane spells. The semi-multi
	does not receive any more spell slots per day than his or her base
	class. As a balancing factor, the semi-multi takes a -2 to Dex and
	Con.
	<br><BR>
	
	<br>KNOWN
	ISSUES:
	<br><BR>
	In some rare cases, you might get a "Spell Learning failed" message. In such
	case, set the difficulty to Easy or Easiest, CLUA in tacprsp2.itm and use it
	to learn the spells you've missed.
	
	<br><BR>
	
	<br>BALANCE:
	<br><BR>
	
	<br>Are these
	semi-classes balanced? If you’re using Big Picture, Tactics, or
	other mods that add multiple very tough encounters then yes. For
	standard BG2? I think so, at least as much as any class once you
	start adding custom spells. The stat penalties feel like a fair
	trade for the extra flexibility, especially as you have only so much
	space in an overcrowded spell book. Like any Jack of all trades the
	semi-multi will still be trumped in any one area by a specialist. On
	the other hand, he is a very good Jack of all trades. The classes
	that gain the most from being turned into a semi-multi are the Bard
	and the Sorcerer; The Sorcerer version is probably overpowered, but
	is still fun to play.
	<br><BR>
	
	<br>WHY:
	<br><BR>
	
	<br>So why
	take this approach? Why not use a Cleric/Mage or Fighter/Cleric/Mage
	as the starting point? That would get you more spells per day, and
	more room in your spell books. On the other hand, you’d lose
	access to weapons, abilities and items unique to the base fighter,
	rogue and mage classes and kits.
	<br><BR>
	
	<br>Why these
	35 spells? I wanted the Undead Turning, as it is probably the single
	most useful ability Clerics have in BG2. The other spells were
	things that fit the theme of a Priest of Mystra, and that didn’t
	duplicate existing Mage spells. I also wanted to avoid excessive
	lower level healing spells; a true Cleric is still a better healer
	and buffer, even as a Semi-Multi is a much better healer and
	somewhat better buffer than a pure arcane caster. 
	
	<br><BR>
	
	<br>SUMMARY:
	<br><BR>
	
	<br>Advantages:
	<br><BR>
	
	<br>1) Access
	to divine spells not available to the base class.
	<br>2) Undead
	turning as a spell.
	<br>3) Full
	range of items and weapons available to the base class.
	<br><BR>
	
	<br>Disadvantages:
	<br><BR>
	
	<br>1) -2 Con
	and Dex, resulting on average in a drop in Hit Points and AC for a
	main PC.
	<br>2) Fewer
	spells per day than a true Cleric/Mage.
	<br>3) More
	limited spell selection than a true Cleric/Mage.
	<br>4)
	Overcrowded Mage book becomes even more so, requiring even more
	careful choices.  
	
	<br><BR>
	
	<br>FUTURE
	PLANS:
	<br><BR>
	
	<br>Version
	1.0 of my upcoming Ritual Magic Mod will include this Semi-Multi
	Mod, as well as one or two more custom spells and five or more new
	items. Version 2.0 of that mod will include some new encounters and
	mini-quests.
